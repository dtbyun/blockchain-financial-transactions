## mod19challenge
 Web3.py and the power of Python functions to automate the process of creating a digital wallet, checking account balances,
 
 and signing and executing transactions.

 Use a mnemonic seed phrase with a digital wallet to create an Ethereum account private key.

Access Ethereum account information, such as an account address and its ether balance.

Authorize and send a blockchain transaction to a Ganache local test environment.

Complete a Streamlit web application that incorporates Ethereum account and transaction functionality and allows users to make 

cryptocurrency payments.



## Getting Started
For this challenge build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger should allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

## Prerequisites
(make sure your conda dev mode is on before installing)

Web3.py : A Python library for connecting to and performing operations on Ethereum-based blockchains.
